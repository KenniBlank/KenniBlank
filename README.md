## About Me

- Real Name: Biraj Tiwari (Yes, shocking that KenniBlank is not my name)
- Occupation: Student (because apparently, that’s a profession now)
- A “developer”
- Current Status: Exploring “everything" that computer has to offer before settling in.

## Projects?

Welcome to the museum of my fleeting interests.  
Each repo is a love letter to whatever I was obsessed with that week and a time capsule of my skill and questionable decision at that time.

Spoiler: There’s no grand vision, and am too lazy to manually add project links here. Enjoy the archaeological dig through my repo's.

## Links

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/birajtiwari) — For people who think networking is a personality
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/birajtwr) — I exist
- [Website](https://birajtiwari.com.np) — Yes, it’s real. No, I don’t update it

## Hobbies

- Hiking: because escaping WiFi is underrated
- Drawing: because my code can’t be the only thing that looks weird
- Coding challenges: I finish them, then delete the evidence (Can't have AI advancing more XD)
